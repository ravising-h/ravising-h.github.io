Object Detection is one of the most basic, yet fascinating concepts of Deep Learning. The key principle is classification of each object into subsequent classes reflecting similar characteristics and drawing a bounding box around it. These classifying features may be as basic as shape or colour, which helps us distinguish them better. With significant advancements in Computer Vision and Image Processing, the applications of Object Detection are being heavily used in medical sciences, autonomous driving, defense and military, public administration and many more sectors.If you are......
